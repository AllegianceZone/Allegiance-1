- wintrek: move 3D settings dialog resource ('picker' resource) in engine
	doofus - don't move the dialog resource into the engine as this is app specific.
- lobby/client.cpp can't use PCH setting because of appweb
- do something with Vorbis (remove or use as a lib (.h/.lib and no source))
- fix mdlc (todo) and mdledit (partially done) for DX9
- move stuff in 'Test' directory to a more logical location then delete 'Test'
- remove unneeded libs in "linker/input/add. dep." setting of all projects
- perform 2nd pass on cleaning .vcproj files
- perform cleaning on ..\standby
- refine all projects dependencies
- DX9 'todo' : see src/engine/TODO.txt

(MAJOR - move tools over to Collada intermediate format for geometry?)
